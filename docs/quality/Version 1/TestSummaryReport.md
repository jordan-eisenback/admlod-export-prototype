# DTN ADMLOD Export Prototype â€“ Test Summary Report

## Project Setup
**Status**: Completed  
- Initialized C# .NET console application  
- Directory structure includes `/MockFiles` for mock data and responses

## Mock Data Implementation
**Status**: Completed  
- `MockData.cs` includes:
  - Three valid products: Diesel #1, Gasoline Regular, Ethanol 95  
  - Two valid product groups: DIESEL, GASOLINE  
  - Three error cases: missing product name, missing product family, missing product code

## ADMLOD Export File Generation
**Status**: Completed  
- `AdmLodFileGen.cs` generates:
  - Header: `VERSION;2.4;`  
  - Export command: `EXPORT;PGRP;;Y;`  
  - MERGE lines for product groups and products  
- Output saved to `/MockFiles/adm_export.txt`

## FTP Upload Simulation
**Status**: Completed  
- `FtpClientMock.cs` writes the export file to `/MockFiles`  
- FTP failure simulation triggered via `--error` CLI flag

## Mock DTN Response Files
**Status**: Completed  
- `adm_response_success.txt`: contains only successful responses  
- `adm_response_error.txt`: includes at least four errors (missing fields, invalid format)

## Response Parsing
**Status**: Completed  
- `ResponseParser.cs`:
  - Parses response files  
  - Distinguishes success and error lines  
  - Returns counts for automated validation

## Logging
**Status**: Completed  
- Console logging implemented  
- File logging supported via `--logfile <filename>` argument

## CLI Argument Handling
**Status**: Completed  
- Supports:
  - `export` command  
  - `--success` and `--error` flags  
  - `--logfile <filename>` for optional logging  
- Handles invalid or missing arguments gracefully

## Error Scenario Simulation
**Status**: Completed  
- Simulated:
  - Missing required fields in mock data  
  - FTP upload failure  
  - Invalid command format in export file  
  - Errors in DTN response file

## Output Review and Acceptance
**Status**: Completed  
- Export file matches ADMLOD format  
- Parsed response output matches mock response files  
- Both success and error flows demonstrated and validated

## Documentation
**Status**: Completed  
- README includes:
  - Build and run instructions  
  - CLI usage examples  
  - Description of mock data and error simulation  
  - Structure of mock files and how to modify them for testing

## Testing
**Status**: Completed  
- All test cases from the test plan executed  
- CLI output and logs validated  
- Automated pass/fail logic implemented

## Summary of Response Parsing
