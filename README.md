Markdown# ADMLOD Export Prototype ‚Äì Integration Framework
## Overview
This prototype simulates integration with the DTN ADMLOD FTP interface. It generates ADMLOD-compliant export files for Products and Product Groups using mock data, simulates FTP upload, and parses mock DTN response files. It supports both success and error scenarios and is designed as a reusable framework for integration prototypes across teams.

---## Getting Started for Developers

###  1. Understand the Business Context- Read `/docs/business/BusinessContext.md`- Review `/docs/business/Glossary.md` and `/docs/business/Personas.md`
### 2. Set Up Locally- Install https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download- Clone the repo and navigate to the root- Run `dotnet build`---## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration SupportThe prototype supports external configuration via `appsettings.json`, allowing flexible control over paths, logging, and feature flags.

### Sample `appsettings.json`{  "Paths": {    "ExportFile": "MockFiles/adm_export.txt",    "ResponseSuccessFile": "MockFiles/adm_response_success.txt",    "ResponseErrorFile": "MockFiles/adm_response_error.txt",    "LogFile": "MockFiles/export.log"  },  "Logging": {    "EnableFileLogging": true,    "LogLevel": "INFO"  },  "FeatureFlags": {    "SimulateFtpFailure": false,    "EnableDynamicResponse": true  }}

Notes:
CLI flags override values in appsettings.json.
If EnableFileLogging is true, logs are saved to the file specified in Paths.LogFile.
SimulateFtpFailure can be toggled to test FTP error handling.


Run Export Scenarios
Success Scenario
Shelldotnet run export --success
Error Scenario
Shelldotnet run export --error
With Logging to File
Shelldotnet run export --success --logfile logfile1_successdotnet run export --error --logfile logfile2_errors

CLI flags override configuration values when specified.


Review Outputs

Export file: /MockFiles/adm_export.txt (or path from appsettings.json)
Response files: /MockFiles/adm_response_success.txt, /MockFiles/adm_response_error.txt
Logs: Console output and optional file output (logfile1_success, logfile2_errors)


Testing

Run automated tests using dotnet test
Validate export content, FTP simulation, and response parsing
Expand test coverage using mock repositories and dependency injection

| :_: | :-: |
|Program.cs | CLI orchestration and argument parsing |
MockData.csSupplies mock Products and Product GroupsAdmLodFileGen.csGenerates ADMLOD export file contentFtpClientMock.csSimulates FTP upload (local write + logging)ResponseParser.csParses DTN response filesLogger.csLogs actions and errors to console or file
See 09.Example Snippets.docx for sample usage patterns and implementation tips.

üåü Key Highlights
Fully mocked environment‚Äîno live FTP or DTN integration
Demonstrates traceability from requirements to test cases
Supports error simulation and structured logging
Modular design for reuse across integration prototypes
SPARC-aligned documentation for stakeholder clarity
